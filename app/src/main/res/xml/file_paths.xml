        file_paths.xml – a sneaky but crucial config file for Android’s FileProvider system.

        This XML isn’t part of the UI—it tells Android which files we’re *allowed* to share with other apps.
        Think of it like a hall pass: without it, the system throws a tantrum and blocks your file sharing attempts
        like a lunch lady guarding the last tray of nuggets.

        In our case, we're using <external-cache-path> to safely point to the app’s external cache directory.
        This is where we temporarily drop the JSON file when the user wants to sync or export inventory data.
        By declaring it here, Android knows it’s cool to hand off that file to Bluetooth, Nearby Share, etc.

        TL;DR: Without this file, your “Share Inventory” button would be nothing more than an elaborate prank.
